This problem is limited and will only occur when your user account is connected to a central server. You will get this message when trying to create a new project.

com.intellij.openapi.options.ConfigurationException: Failed to import a new Gradle project: Could not fetch a model of type "IdeaProject" using Gradle distribution "http://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-1.6-bin.zip".
Unable to start the daemon process.

This problem might be caused by an incorrect configuration of the daemon.

For example, an unrecognized jvm option is used.

Please refer to the user guide chapter on the daemon at: http://gradle.org/docs/1.6/userguide/gradle_daemon.html

Cause

Android Studio is trying to access Gradle from the server path and is unable to access it due to permissions or maybe the path is something like "\\ServerName\UserProfiles\naveen\.gradle".

Solution

Well I was not able to find any perfect solution to this problem, I changed the gradle path by adding the GRADLE_HOME variable to the Environment variables but still no use. 

So the end result was to disconnect the system from a centralized network and do a fresh install of Android Studio. 

Due to the early phase of Android Studio, you may encounter additional problems while installing and running it.
