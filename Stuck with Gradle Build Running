Actually it is not stuck. It takes more time to build. I have got almost 3 solutions that can fix the issue.

Solution-1:

Following the steps will make it 10 times faster and reduce build time 90%

First create a file named gradle.properties in the following directory:

/home/<username>/.gradle/ (Linux)
/Users/<username>/.gradle/ (Mac)
C:\Users\<username>\.gradle (Windows)
Add this line to the file:

org.gradle.daemon=true

org.gradle.parallel=true
Solution-2:

If Android Studio has a proxy server setting and can't reach the server then it takes a long time to build, probably its trying to reach the proxy server and waiting for a timeout. When I removed the proxy server setting its working fine.

In Android Studio go to File -> Settings -> Build, Execution, Deployment -> Buil Tools -> Gradle

Check the 'Offline work' under 'Global Gradle settings'

It will reduce 90% gradle build time.

Solution-3

If you are using Google Play services, make sure you aren't using this in your Gradle build script:

compile 'com.google.android.gms:play-services:8.3.0'
Only use those Google APIs that your app is really using. If all you are using is Google Maps, you would use this:

com.google.android.gms:play-services-maps:8.3.0
When I did this, my compile time went from over 2 minutes to around 25 seconds. For a list of the Google apis that you can selectively compile against, see:
